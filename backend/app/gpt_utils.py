- Essay maintains a clear, specific, and prompt appropriate focus that develops a clear, consistent main idea throughout the entire essay.
- Essay develops purpose with an original, interesting angle
- Writer has provided enough detail for the reader to easily follow the essay, in a “show, don't tell” manner with no extra details.
- Writer comes across appropriately to the essay's target audience. Essay uses appropriate tone and details to present writer as compelling candidate for admission.
- Writer uses intentional and vivid language choices that make writer's voice rich, personal, and honest and very distinctive. It is devoid of clichés, vagueness, and laziness with language. It directly aids in achieving the essay's purpose.
- The structure establishes a relationship between/among ideas/events and transitions help to clarify the order of events.
- Exhibits EXCELLENT CONTROL of grammatical conventions appropriate to the writing task: standard usage including agreement, tense and case; and mechanics

Restate the exact sentences line by line of the college essay in bold for improvement and give the feedback on the part. Give 2-3 suggestions of how they could improve that part of the essay. DO NOT JUST SAY, “introduction” , “transitions”, but rather quote SPECIFIC LINES of the TEXT.
